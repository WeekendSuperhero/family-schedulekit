## Common Questions

### Q: I'm a freelancer. Do I need a commercial license?

**A:** If you're using this software to provide paid services to clients (e.g., building custody schedule apps for law firms), yes, you need a commercial license. If you're just managing your own personal custody schedule, the PolyForm Noncommercial license is fine.

### Q: Our non-profit uses this to help families. Which license?

**A:** 501(c)(3) organizations and equivalent non-profits can use the PolyForm Noncommercial license even if they charge nominal fees to cover costs. If you're generating significant revenue, contact us for non-profit pricing.

### Q: Can we evaluate before purchasing?

**A:** Absolutely! We offer 30-day evaluation licenses. Email weekend@weekendsuperhero.io to request one.

### Q: What if we outgrow our tier?

**A:** You can upgrade at any time. We'll prorate your current license and apply it to the new tier.

### Q: Do you offer discounts?

**A:** Yes! We offer:

- Multi-year prepay discounts (10-20%)
- Non-profit pricing (case-by-case)
- Startup program participants (contact us)
- Educational institution pricing
- Volume licensing discounts

### Q: What's the attribution requirement?

**A:** Under the PolyForm Noncommercial license, you must:

- Preserve the copyright notice: `Copyright (c) 2025 Weekend Superhero LLC (https://weekendsuperhero.io)`
- Include a copy of the license terms or URL when distributing
- This is automatic if you keep the LICENSE files with the software

### Q: Is the source code available to commercial licensees?

**A:** Yes! The source code is public on GitHub. Commercial licenses grant you the right to use, modify, and deploy it commercially.

### Q: Can we contribute back to the project?

**A:** Yes! We welcome contributions under our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This allows us to maintain the dual-license model while accepting community improvements.

### Q: What happens if we don't comply?

**A:** We believe in good-faith communication. If you're using this commercially without a license, we'll reach out to help you get compliant. Continued non-compliance may result in legal action, but we'd much rather work with you!

### Q: Can we get a perpetual license?

**A:** We primarily offer annual subscriptions with ongoing updates and support. Perpetual licenses for specific versions are available for Enterprise tier customers. Contact us to discuss.

## Comparison: PolyForm Noncommercial vs. MIT License

We previously used MIT, but switched to PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 for these reasons:

| **Commercial Use** | ✓ Free (no control) | ✗ Requires paid license            |
| **Attribution**    | Required            | Required                           |
| **Modification**   | ✓ Allowed           | ✓ Allowed                          |
| **Distribution**   | ✓ Allowed           | ✓ Allowed (non-commercial)         |
| **Patent Grant**   | No                  | Yes                                |
| **Sustainability** | Donation-based      | Commercial licensing               |
